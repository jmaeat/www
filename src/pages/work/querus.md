## Background

A few years ago, my Dad purchased the [querus.io](https://querus.io/) domain for a side-business that never ended up launching. Today, he's a facilitator for the online community MenLiving. He uses this custom domain for all MenLiving engagements.

My Dad wanted a digital business card instead of an error page. In case someone looked up the custom domain from his email, it would go *somewhere*.

## Process

As always, the design began in Figma.

  I chose the typeface Calendus Plus from [atipo foundry](https://www.atipofoundry.com/) solely because of the beautiful ligatures.
