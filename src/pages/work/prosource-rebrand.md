ProSource provides IT services for healthcare, engineering, finance, and manufacturing companies.

## Background

When I started at ProSource, the company pitched itself as a soup to nuts IT provider for every industry. As the team complexity changed and became more specialized, our client demographic shifted. By 2021, over 70% of our clients were in healthcare or a healthcare-adjacent industry.

To capitalize on this high-complexity industry where we knew our impact would be greatest, we started conversations about a rebrand. At this point in time, we had four distinct arms of the business that would need to be unified:
1. ProSource Cloud Services &mdash; data center and hosted services
2. ProSource Medical Consulting &mdash; healthcare-specific consulting services
3. ProSource Technology Solutions &mdash; managed IT services
4. ProSource Voice Services &mdash; VoIP and faxing services

Prior to the rebrand, ProSource marketed its services under each a discreet line of business. This confused customers who consumed multiple services from us. And the healthcare-specific distinction, in the case of Medical Consulting, made it seem like the rest of our services *weren't* healthcare-specific.
