Perhaps it was when social media turned *anti*social and *para*social, or when Silicon Valley promised to solve society's biggest inequities and inefficiencies but ended up becoming the villain, or when crypto-grifters seemed to capture the cultural and technological zeitgeist with low-quality, low-effort digital kitsch — my outlook on technology has soured.

Without a doubt, the Internet has been a boon to humankind. New opportunities, a greater quality of life, and an unfathomably vast library of our collective knowledge. But, for better or worse, we've taken the good with the bad. It seems for every one or two _good_ features the Internet has provided, we discover new ways the Internet has become a tool wielded by the powerful to manipulate, divide, and engineer us.

With one hand, technology empowers marginalized groups TK. With its other hand, technology reduces us to mere bytes. We are nothing but our data, and this data is secured haphazardly at best — distributed, resold, or leaked to anyone wanting to target our individual preferences, socioeconomic status, and nostalgia-induced addictions.

I work in and with tech on a daily basis, so all my woes seem like hypocrisy. I started in tech because I wasn't good at much else and didn't know where else to turn.
