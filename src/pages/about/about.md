Hi, there. My name is John.

I’m a content strategist from Orlando living in Tacoma. I love working at the intersection of content and design. When I’m not at my desk, I’m most likely [hiking](/hikes) around the beautiful state of WA.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmaeat) or [GitHub](https://github.com/jmaeat).

## Colophon

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a small amount of CSS, and almost no JavaScript (I’m not very good at it anyway). There are no trackers or ads on this site — rejoice!

This site is set in [General Sans](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/general-sans) by Indian Type Foundry.
