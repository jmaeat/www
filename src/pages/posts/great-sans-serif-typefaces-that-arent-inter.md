We get it. You're starting a new bootstrapped micro-SaaS with a landing page that looks like this:

*Insert Tailwind CSS looking mockup here.*

Before you ship your designs, though, let's consider one small change that'll have a huge impact. Don't use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).

Inter is a great typeface, don't get me wrong, but I am weary of its presence as the *de facto* standard for the majority of tech/SaaS marketing websites out there. I'm going to showcase a few free and paid examples that will help your designs stand out a bit more.

## The paid alternatives

Maybe your project has a healthy budget, you like supporting boutique type foundries, or you've got some money burning a hole in your pocket — whatever your specific reason, I think you should always strive to buy typefaces whenever you can. Free typefaces are great, but premium typefaces have discretionary ligatures, optical sizing, and stylistic alternatives that can help customize the look.

### Söhne

Söhne from Klim Type Foundry is an Akzidenz-Grotesk inspired typeface that looks fantastic in small sizes. It comes in 16 styles, which makes it great alternative to Inter. Söhne is actually part of a superfamily: there's also Söhne Mono, Söhne Schmal (condensed), and Söhne Breit (extended). Superfamiles make pairings easy when you aren't sure how to contrast with another typeface.
