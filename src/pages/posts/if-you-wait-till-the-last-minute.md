A major overhaul was in order. Not just for the website, but for the ProSource brand as well. In spring of 2020, the company took steps to narrow its target audience to industries where high-complexity and high-growth would be the norm. I worked with the Business Development team on new collateral and a marketing website that would speak to our target audience — the new brand, website, *everything* was scheduled to go live at the beginning of September.

When I first started at ProSource, my experience with websites had been drag-and-drop WordPress theme builders. I was determined to learn web development the right way and *not* use terrible theme builders for our rebrand project. The COVID lockdowns in early 2020 provided a unique opportunity. I used all of my downtime to learn front-end web development fundamentals.

I took a few courses on Udemy, learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even some CSS frameworks, namely Bootstrap (yikes!) and Tailwind CSS. Initially, my plan was to create a *custom* theme for a WordPress site, rather than use drag-and-drop builder plugins.

The first starter theme I tried using was [underscores](https://github.com/automattic/_s). Mind you, I didn't really know PHP at all, but I figured I could slog through it in a pinch. The early iterations of the site were awful — I mean, just *awful.* I was using Bootstrap, jQuery, and a whole bunch of other stuff that makes me chuckle when I think back to it.

Somehow during this brief, dark period, I stumbled on the Roots [Sage](https://roots.io/sage) and [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock) packages. The Roots team really piqued my interest. Their projects offer modern tooling and development experience for WordPress. I joined their Slack group, scoured docs, videos, and anything I could find to help my journey. Mind you (again): I already didn't know PHP well, but add on to this that Sage brings Laravel into the picture. Reader, I didn't know this at the time, but I was in over my head.

By mid-summer, I had serious doubts that I could launch the new marketing site. The CI/CD pipeline was awful for me to figure out, my inexperience with PHP/Laravel (at the time) was proving to be a large roadblock, and I was a development team of one. Help was not on the way. I had to figure out a solution quickly.

Just when I thought
